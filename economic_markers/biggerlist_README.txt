Notes
----------------------------------------------------------------------
The ICE BofAML Option-Adjusted Spreads (OASs) are the calculated      
spreads between a computed OAS index of all bonds in a given rating   
category and a spot Treasury curve. An OAS index is constructed using 
each constituent bond‚Äôs OAS, weighted by market capitalization. 
The Corporate Master OAS uses an index of bonds that are considered   
investment grade (those rated BBB or better). When the last calendar  
day of the month takes place on the weekend, weekend observations will
occur as a result of month ending accrued interest adjustments.       
                                                                      
This data represents the ICE BofAML US Corporate Master Index value,  
which tracks the performance of US dollar denominated investment grade
rated corporate debt publically issued in the US domestic market. To  
qualify for inclusion in the index, securities must have an investment
grade rating (based on an average of Moody's, S&P, and Fitch) and an  
investment grade rated country of risk (based on an average of        
Moody's, S&P, and Fitch foreign currency long term sovereign debt     
ratings). Each security must have greater than 1 year of remaining    
maturity, a fixed coupon schedule, and a minimum amount outstanding of
$250 million. Original issue zero coupon bonds, "global" securities   
(debt issued simultaneously in the eurobond and US                    
domestic bond markets), 144a securities and pay-in-kind securities,   
including toggle notes, qualify for inclusion in the Index. Callable  
perpetual securities qualify provided they are at least one year from 
the first call date. Fixed-to-floating rate securities also qualify   
provided they are callable within the fixed rate period and are at    
least one year from the last call prior to the date the bond          
transitions from a fixed to a floating rate security. DRD-eligible and
defaulted securities are excluded from the Index                      
                                                                      
ICE BofAML Explains the Construction Methodology of this series as:   
Index constituents are capitalization-weighted based on their current 
amount outstanding. With the exception of U.S.                        
mortgage pass-throughs and U.S. structured products (ABS, CMBS and    
CMOs), accrued interest is calculated assuming                        
next-day settlement. Accrued interest for U.S. mortgage pass-through  
and U.S. structured products is calculated assuming                   
same-day settlement. Cash flows from bond payments that are received  
during the month are retained in the index until                      
the end of the month and then are removed as part of the rebalancing. 
Cash does not earn any reinvestment income while                      
it is held in the Index. The Index is rebalanced on the last calendar 
day of the month, based on information available up to                
and including the third business day before the last business day of  
the month. Issues that meet the qualifying criteria are               
included in the Index for the following month. Issues that no longer  
meet the criteria during the course of the month                      
remain in the Index until the next month-end rebalancing at which     
point they are removed from the Index.

Notes
----------------------------------------------------------------------
This data represents the ICE BofAML US Corporate Master Index value,  
which tracks the performance of US dollar denominated investment grade
rated corporate debt publically issued in the US domestic market. To  
qualify for inclusion in the index, securities must have an investment
grade rating (based on an average of Moody's, S&P, and Fitch) and an  
investment grade rated country of risk (based on an average of        
Moody's, S&P, and Fitch foreign currency long term sovereign debt     
ratings). Each security must have greater than 1 year of remaining    
maturity, a fixed coupon schedule, and a minimum amount outstanding of
$250 million. Original issue zero coupon bonds, "global" securities   
(debt issued simultaneously in the eurobond and US                    
domestic bond markets), 144a securities and pay-in-kind securities,   
including toggle notes, qualify for inclusion in the Index. Callable  
perpetual securities qualify provided they are at least one year from 
the first call date. Fixed-to-floating rate securities also qualify   
provided they are callable within the fixed rate period and are at    
least one year from the last call prior to the date the bond          
transitions from a fixed to a floating rate security. DRD-eligible and
defaulted securities are excluded from the Index                      
                                                                      
ICE BofAML Explains the Construction Methodology of this series as:   
Index constituents are capitalization-weighted based on their current

This data represents the effective yield of the ICE BofAML Emerging   
Markets Corporate Plus Index                                          
(https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/BAMLEMCBPITRIV?cid=32413), which  
tracks the performance of US dollar (USD) and Euro denominated        
emerging markets non-sovereign debt publicly issued within the major  
domestic and Eurobond markets. To qualify for inclusion in the index, 
the issuer of debt must have risk exposure to countries other than    
members of the FX G10 (US, Japan, New Zealand, Australia, Canada,     
Sweden, UK, Switzerland, Norway, and Euro Currency Members), all      
Western European countries, and territories of the US and Western     
European countries. Each security must also be denominated in USD or  
Euro with a time to maturity greater than 1 year and have a fixed     
coupon. For inclusion in the index, investment grade rated bonds of   
qualifying issuers must have at least 250 million (Euro or USD) in    
outstanding face value, and below investment grade rated bonds must   
have at least 100 million (Euro or USD) in outstanding face value. The
index includes corporate and quasi-government debt of qualifying      
countries, but excludes sovereign and supranational debt. Other types 
of securities acceptable for inclusion in this index are: original    
issue zero coupon bonds, ‚Äúglobal‚Äù securities (debt issued 
in the US domestic bond markets as well the Eurobond Market           
simultaneously), 144a securities, pay-in-kind securities (includes    
toggle notes), callable perpetual securities (qualify if they are at  
least one year from the first call date), fixed-to-floating rate      
securities (qualify if the securities are callable within the fixed   
rate period and are at least one year from the last call prior to the 
date the bond transitions from a fixed to a floating rate security).  
Defaulted securities are excluded from the Index.                     
ICE BofAML Explains the Construction Methodology of this series as:   
Index constituents are capitalization-weighted based on their current 
amount outstanding. With the exception of US mortgage pass-throughs   
and US structured products (ABS, CMBS and CMOs), accrued interest is  
calculated assuming next-day settlement. Accrued interest for US      
mortgage pass-through and US structured products is calculated        
assuming same-day settlement. Cash flows from bond payments that are  
received during the month are retained in the index until the end of  
the month and then are removed as part of the rebalancing. Cash does  
not earn any reinvestment income while it is held in the Index. The   
Index is rebalanced on the last calendar day of the month, based on   
information available up to and including the third business day      
before the last business day of the month. Issues that meet the       
qualifying criteria are included in the Index for the following month.
Issues that no longer meet the criteria during the course of the month
remain in the Index until the next month-end rebalancing at which     
point they are removed from the Index.                                
                                                                      
When the last calendar day of the month takes place on the weekend,   
weekend observations will occur as a result of month ending accrued   
interest adjustments.

coupon. For inclusion in the index, investment grade rated bonds of   
qualifying issuers must have at least 250 million (Euro or USD) in    
outstanding face value, and below investment grade rated bonds must   
have at least 100 million (Euro or USD) in outstanding face value. The
index includes corporate and quasi-government debt of qualifying      
countries, but excludes sovereign and supranational debt. Other types 
of securities acceptable for inclusion in this index are: original    
issue zero coupon bonds, ‚Äúglobal‚Äù securities (debt issued 
in the US domestic bond markets as well the Eurobond Market           
simultaneously), 144a securities, pay-in-kind securities (includes    
toggle notes), callable perpetual securities (qualify if they are at  
least one year from the first call date), fixed-to-floating rate      
securities (qualify if the securities are callable within the fixed   
rate period and are at least one year from the last call prior to the 
date the bond transitions from a fixed to a floating rate security).  
Defaulted securities are excluded from the Index.                     
ICE BofAML Explains the Construction Methodology of this series as:   
Index constituents are capitalization-weighted based on their current 
amount outstanding. With the exception of US mortgage pass-throughs   
and US structured products (ABS, CMBS and CMOs), accrued interest is  
calculated assuming next-day settlement. Accrued interest for US      
mortgage pass-through and US structured products is calculated        
assuming same-day settlement. Cash flows from bond payments that are  
received during the month are retained in the index until             
the end of the month and then are removed as part of the rebalancing. 
Cash does not earn any reinvestment income while it is held in the    
Index. The Index is rebalanced on the last calendar day of the month, 
based on information available up to and including the third business 
day before the last business day of the month. Issues that meet the   
qualifying criteria are included in the Index for the following month.
Issues that no longer meet the criteria during the course of the month
remain in the Index until the next month-end rebalancing at which     
point they are removed from the Index.                                
                                                                      
The ICE BofAML OASs are the calculated spreads between a computed OAS 
index of all bonds in a given rating category and a spot Treasury     
curve. An OAS index is constructed using each constituent bond‚Äôs
OAS, weighted by market capitalization. When the last calendar day of 
the month takes place on the weekend, weekend observations will occur 
as a result of month ending accrued interest adjustments. When the    
last calendar day of the month takes place on the weekend, weekend

The ICE BofAML Option-Adjusted Spreads (OASs) are the calculated      
spreads between a computed OAS index of all bonds in a given rating   
category and a spot Treasury curve. An OAS index is constructed using 
each constituent bond‚Äôs OAS, weighted by market capitalization. 
The ICE BofAML High Yield Master II OAS uses an index of bonds that   
are below investment grade (those rated BB or below).                 
This data represents the ICE BofAML US High Yield Master II Index     
value, which tracks the performance of US dollar denominated below    
investment grade rated corporate debt publically issued in the US     
domestic market. To qualify for inclusion in the index, securities    
must have a below investment grade rating (based on an average of     
Moody's, S&P, and Fitch) and an investment grade rated country of risk
(based on an average of Moody's, S&P, and Fitch foreign currency long 
term sovereign debt ratings). Each security must have greater than 1  
year of remaining maturity, a fixed coupon schedule, and a minimum    
amount outstanding of $100 million. Original issue zero coupon bonds, 
"global" securities (debt issued simultaneously in the eurobond and US
domestic bond markets), 144a securities and pay-in-kind securities,   
including toggle notes, qualify for inclusion in the Index. Callable  
perpetual securities qualify provided they are at least one year from 
the first call date. Fixed-to-floating rate securities also qualify   
provided they are callable within the fixed rate period and are at    
least one year from the last call prior to the date the bond          
transitions from a fixed to a floating rate security. DRD-eligible and
defaulted securities are excluded from the Index                      
                                                                      
ICE BofAML Explains the Construction Methodology of this series as:   
Index constituents are capitalization-weighted based on their current 
amount outstanding. With the exception of U.S. mortgage pass-throughs 
and U.S. structured products (ABS, CMBS and CMOs), accrued interest is
calculated assuming next-day settlement. Accrued interest for U.S.    
mortgage pass-through and U.S. structured products is calculated      
assuming same-day settlement. Cash flows from bond payments that are  
received during the month are retained in the index until the end of  
the month and then are removed as part of the rebalancing. Cash does  
not earn any reinvestment income while it is held in the Index. The   
Index is rebalanced on the last calendar day of the month, based on   
information available up to and including the third business day      
before the last business day of the month. Issues that meet the       
qualifying criteria are included in the Index for the following month.
Issues that no longer meet the criteria during the course of the month
remain in the Index until the next month-end rebalancing at which     
point they are removed from the Index.                                
                                                                      
When the last calendar day of the month takes place on the weekend,   
weekend observations will occur as a result of month ending accrued   
interest adjustments.

This data represents the semi-annual yield to worst of the ICE BofAML 
US High Yield Master II Index, which tracks the performance of US     
dollar denominated below investment grade rated corporate debt        
publically issued in the US domestic market. To qualify for inclusion 
in the index, securities must have a below investment grade rating    
(based on an average of Moody's, S&P, and Fitch) and an investment    
grade rated country of risk (based on an average of Moody's, S&P, and 
Fitch foreign currency long term sovereign debt ratings). Each        
security must have greater than 1 year of remaining maturity, a fixed 
coupon schedule, and a minimum amount outstanding of $100 million.    
Original issue zero coupon bonds, "global" securities (debt issued    
simultaneously in the eurobond and US domestic bond markets), 144a    
securities and pay-in-kind securities, including toggle notes, qualify
for inclusion in the Index. Callable perpetual securities qualify     
provided they are at least one year from the first call date.         
Fixed-to-floating rate securities also qualify provided they are      
callable within the fixed rate period and are at least one year from  
the last call prior to the date the bond transitions from a fixed to a
floating rate security. DRD-eligible and defaulted securities are     
excluded from the Index                                               
                                                                      
ICE BofAML Explains the Construction Methodology of this series as:   
Index constituents are capitalization-weighted based on their current 
amount outstanding. With the exception of U.S. mortgage pass-throughs 
and U.S. structured products (ABS, CMBS and CMOs), accrued interest is
calculated assuming next-day settlement. Accrued interest for U.S.    
mortgage pass-through and U.S. structured products is calculated      
assuming same-day settlement. Cash flows from bond payments that are  
received during the month are retained in the index until the end of  
the month and then are removed as part of the rebalancing. Cash does  
not earn any reinvestment income while it is held in the Index. The   
Index is rebalanced on the last calendar day of the month, based on   
information available up to and including the third business day      
before the last business day of the month. Issues that meet the       
qualifying criteria are included in the Index for the following month.
Issues that no longer meet the criteria during the course of the month
remain in the Index until the next month-end rebalancing at which     
point they are removed from the Index.                                
Yield to worst is the lowest potential yield that a bond can generate 
without the issuer defaulting. The standard US convention for this    
series is to use semi-annual coupon payments, whereas the standard in 
the foreign markets is to use coupon payment frequencies of annual,   
semi-annual, quarterly, and monthly. When the last calendar day of the
month takes place on the weekend, weekend observations will occur as a
result of month ending accrued interest adjustments.

This data represents the effective yield of the ICE BofAML Euro High  
Yield Index tracks the performance of Euro denominated below          
investment grade corporate debt publicly issued in the euro domestic  
or eurobond markets. Qualifying securities must have a below          
investment grade rating (based on an average of Moody's, S&P, and     
Fitch). Qualifying securities must have at least one year remaining   
term to maturity, a fixed coupon schedule, and a minimum amount       
outstanding of Euro 100 million. Original issue zero coupon bonds,    
"global" securities (debt issued simultaneously in the eurobond and   
euro domestic markets), 144a securities and pay-in-kind securities,   
including toggle notes, qualify for inclusion in the Index. Callable  
perpetual securities qualify provided they are at least one year from 
the first call date. Fixed-to-floating rate securities also qualify   
provided they are callable within the fixed rate period and are at    
least one year from the last call prior to the date the bond          
transitions from a fixed to a floating rate security. Defaulted,      
warrant-bearing and euro legacy currency securities are excluded from 
the Index.                                                            
                                                                      
ICE BofAML Explains the Construction Methodology of this series as:   
Index constituents are capitalization-weighted based on their current 
amount outstanding. With the exception of U.S. mortgage pass-throughs 
and U.S. structured products (ABS, CMBS and CMOs), accrued interest is
calculated assuming next-day settlement. Accrued interest for U.S.    
mortgage pass-through and U.S. structured products is calculated      
assuming same-day settlement. Cash flows from bond payments that are  
received during the month are retained in the index until             
the end of the month and then are removed as part of the rebalancing. 
Cash does not earn any reinvestment income while it is held in the    
Index. The Index is rebalanced on the last calendar day of the month, 
based on information available up to and including the third business 
day before the last business day of the month. Issues that meet the   
qualifying criteria are included in the Index for the following month.
Issues that no longer meet the criteria during the course of the month
remain in the Index until the next month-end rebalancing at which     
point they are removed from the Index.

This time series is an interpretation of Organisation of Economic     
Development (OECD) Composite Leading Indicators: Reference Turning    
Points and Component Series data, which can be found at               
http://www.oecd.org/std/leading-indicators/oecdcompositeleadingindicat
The OECD identifies months of turning points without designating a    
date within the month that turning points occurred. The dummy variable
adopts an arbitrary convention that the turning point occurred at a   
specific date within the month. The arbitrary convention does not     
reflect any judgment on this issue by the OECD. Our time series is    
composed of dummy variables that represent periods of expansion and   
recession. A value of 1 is a recessionary period, while a value of 0  
is an expansionary period. For this time series, the recession begins 
on the 15th day of the month of the peak and ends on the 15th day of  
the month of the trough. This time series is a disaggregation of the  
monthly series. For more options on recession shading, see the note   
and links below.                                                      
                                                                      
The recession shading data that we provide initially comes from the   
source as a list of dates that are either an economic peak or trough. 
We interpret dates into recession shading data using one of three     
arbitrary methods. All of our recession shading data is available     
using all three interpretations. The period between a peak and trough 
is always shaded as a recession. The peak and trough are collectively 
extrema. Depending on the application, the extrema, both individually 
and collectively, may be included in the recession period in whole or 
in part. In situations where a portion of a period is included in the 
recession, the whole period is deemed to be included in the recession 
period.                                                               
                                                                      
The first interpretation, known as the midpoint method, is to show a  
recession from the midpoint of the peak through the midpoint of the   
trough for monthly and quarterly data. For daily data, the recession  
begins on the 15th of the month of the peak and ends on the 15th of   
the month of the trough. Daily data is a disaggregation of monthly    
data. For monthly and quarterly data, the entire peak and trough      
periods are included in the recession shading. This method shows the  
maximum number of periods as a recession for monthly and quarterly    
data. The Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis uses this method in its   
own publications. The midpoint method is used for this series.        
                                                                      
The second interpretation, known as the trough method, is to show a   
recession from the period following the peak through the trough (i.e. 
the peak is not included in the recession shading, but the trough is).
For daily data, the recession begins on the first day of the first    
month following the peak and ends on the last day of the month of the 
trough. Daily data is a disaggregation of monthly data. The trough    
method is used when displaying data on FRED graphs. A version of this 
time series represented using the trough method can be found at:

The third interpretation, known as the peak method, is to show a      
recession from the period of the peak to the trough (i.e. the peak is 
included in the recession shading, but the trough is not). For daily  
data, the recession begins on the first day of the month of the peak  
and ends on the last day of the month preceding the trough. Daily data
is a disaggregation of monthly data. A version of this time series    
represented using the peak method can be found at:

The OECD CLI system is based on the "growth cycle" approach, where    
business cycles and turning points are measured and identified in the 
deviation-from-trend series. The main reference series used in the    
OECD CLI system for the majority of countries is industrial production
(IIP) covering all industry sectors excluding construction. This      
series is used because of its cyclical sensitivity and monthly        
availability, while the broad based Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is   
used to supplement the IIP series for identification of the final     
reference turning points in the growth cycle.                         
                                                                      
Zones aggregates of the CLIs and the reference series are calculated  
as weighted averages of the corresponding zone member series (i.e.    
CLIs and IIPs).                                                       
                                                                      
Up to December 2008 the turning points chronologies shown for         
regional/zone area aggregates or individual countries are determined  
by the rules established by the National Bureau of Economic Research  
(NBER) in the United States, which have been formalized and           
incorporated in a computer routine (Bry and Boschan) and included in  
the Phase-Average Trend (PAT) de-trending procedure. Starting from    
December 2008 the turning point detection algorithm is decoupled from 
the de-trending procedure, and is a simplified version of the original
Bry and Boschan routine. (The routine parses local minima and maxima  
in the cycle series and applies censor rules to guarantee alternating 
peaks and troughs, as well as phase and cycle length constraints.)    
                                                                      
The components of the CLI are time series which exhibit leading       
relationship with the reference series (IIP) at turning points.       
Country CLIs are compiled by combining de-trended smoothed and        
normalized components. The component series for each country are      
selected based on various criteria such as economic significance;     
cyclical behavior; data quality; timeliness and availability.

This time series is an interpretation of Organisation of Economic     
Development (OECD) Composite Leading Indicators: Reference Turning    
Points and Component Series data, which can be found at               
http://www.oecd.org/std/leading-indicators/oecdcompositeleadingindicat
The OECD identifies months of turning points without designating a    
date within the month that turning points occurred. The dummy variable
adopts an arbitrary convention that the turning point occurred at a   
specific date within the month. The arbitrary convention does not     
reflect any judgment on this issue by the OECD. Our time series is    
composed of dummy variables that represent periods of expansion and   
recession. A value of 1 is a recessionary period, while a value of 0  
is an expansionary period. For this time series, the recession begins 
the first day of the period following a peak and ends on the last day 
of the period of the trough. For more options on recession shading,   
see the notes and links below.                                        
                                                                      
The recession shading data that we provide initially comes from the   
source as a list of dates that are either an economic peak or trough. 
We interpret dates into recession shading data using one of three     
arbitrary methods. All of our recession shading data is available     
using all three interpretations. The period between a peak and trough 
is always shaded as a recession. The peak and trough are collectively 
extrema. Depending on the application, the extrema, both individually 
and collectively, may be included in the recession period in whole or 
in part. In situations where a portion of a period is included in the 
recession, the whole period is deemed to be included in the recession 
period.                                                               
                                                                      
The first interpretation, known as the midpoint method, is to show a  
recession from the midpoint of the peak through the midpoint of the   
trough for monthly and quarterly data. For daily data, the recession  
begins on the 15th of the month of the peak and ends on the 15th of   
the month of the trough. Daily data is a disaggregation of monthly    
data. For monthly and quarterly data, the entire peak and trough      
periods are included in the recession shading. This method shows the  
maximum number of periods as a recession for monthly and quarterly    
data. The Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis uses this method in its   
own publications. A version of this time series represented using the 
midpoint method can be found at:

The second interpretation, known as the trough method, is to show a   
recession from the period following the peak through the trough (i.e. 
the peak is not included in the recession shading, but the trough is).
For daily data, the recession begins on the first day of the first    
month following the peak and ends on the last day of the month of the 
trough. Daily data is a disaggregation of monthly data. The trough    
method is used when displaying data on FRED graphs. The trough method 
is used for this series.                                              
                                                                      
The third interpretation, known as the peak method, is to show a      
recession from the period of the peak to the trough (i.e. the peak is 
included in the recession shading, but the trough is not). For daily  
data, the recession begins on the first day of the month of the peak  
and ends on the last day of the month preceding the trough. Daily data
is a disaggregation of monthly data. A version of this time series    
represented using the peak method can be found at:                    
                                                                      
https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/DEURECDP                           
                                                                      
The OECD CLI system is based on the "growth cycle" approach, where    
business cycles and turning points are measured and identified in the 
deviation-from-trend series. The main reference series used in the    
OECD CLI system for the majority of countries is industrial production
(IIP) covering all industry sectors excluding construction. This      
series is used because of its cyclical sensitivity and monthly        
availability, while the broad based Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is   
used to supplement the IIP series for identification of the final     
reference turning points in the growth cycle.                         
                                                                      
Zones aggregates of the CLIs and the reference series are calculated  
as weighted averages of the corresponding zone member series (i.e.    
CLIs and IIPs).                                                       
                                                                      
Up to December 2008 the turning points chronologies shown for         
regional/zone area aggregates or individual countries are determined  
by the rules established by the National Bureau of Economic Research  
(NBER) in the United States, which have been formalized and           
incorporated in a computer routine (Bry and Boschan) and included in  
the Phase-Average Trend (PAT) de-trending procedure. Starting from    
December 2008 the turning point detection algorithm is decoupled from 
the de-trending procedure, and is a simplified version of the original
Bry and Boschan routine. (The routine parses local minima and maxima  
in the cycle series and applies censor rules to guarantee alternating 
peaks and troughs, as well as phase and cycle length constraints.)    
                                                                      
The components of the CLI are time series which exhibit leading       
relationship with the reference series (IIP) at turning points.       
Country CLIs are compiled by combining de-trended smoothed and        
normalized components. The component series for each country are      
selected based on various criteria such as economic significance;     
cyclical behavior; data quality; timeliness and availability.

Data for the period prior to 1994 come from the working paper "A New  
Federal Funds Rate Target Series: September 27, 1982 - December 31,   
1993" (Thornton, Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, 2005,             
http://research.stlouisfed.org/wp/2005/2005-032.pdf). Due to an error 
in the paper values from April 2, 1986 - April 20, 1986 were adjusted 
manually to 7.3125%. Data from 1994 to the present are derived from   
FOMC meeting transcripts and FOMC meeting statements,

Effective December 16, 2008, target rate is reported as a range.

The federal funds rate is the interest rate at which depository       
institutions trade federal funds (balances held at Federal Reserve    
Banks) with each other overnight. When a depository institution has   
surplus balances in its reserve account, it lends to other banks in   
need of larger balances. In simpler terms, a bank with excess cash,   
which is often referred to as liquidity, will lend to another bank    
that needs to quickly raise liquidity. (1) The rate that the borrowing
institution pays to the lending institution is determined between the 
two banks; the weighted average rate for all of these types of        
negotiations is called the effective federal funds rate.(2) The       
effective federal funds rate is essentially determined by the market  
but is influenced by the Federal Reserve through open market          
operations to reach the federal funds rate target.(2)                 
                                                                      
The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meets eight times a year to  
determine the federal funds target rate. As previously stated, this   
rate influences the effective federal funds rate through open market  
operations or by buying and selling of government bonds (government   
debt).(2) More specifically, the Federal Reserve decreases liquidity  
by selling government bonds, thereby raising the federal funds rate   
because banks have less liquidity to trade with other banks.          
Similarly, the Federal Reserve can increase liquidity by buying       
government bonds, decreasing the federal funds rate because banks have
excess liquidity for trade. Whether the Federal Reserve wants to buy  
or sell bonds depends on the state of the economy. If the FOMC        
believes the economy is growing too fast and inflation pressures are  
inconsistent with the dual mandate of the Federal Reserve, the        
Committee may set a higher federal funds rate target to temper        
economic activity. In the opposing scenario, the FOMC may set a lower 
federal funds rate target to spur greater economic activity.          
Therefore, the FOMC must observe the current state of the economy to  
determine the best course of monetary policy that will maximize       
economic growth while adhering to the dual mandate set forth by       
Congress. In making its monetary policy decisions, the FOMC considers 
a wealth of economic data, such as: trends in prices and wages,       
employment, consumer spending and income, business investments, and   
foreign exchange markets.                                             
                                                                      
The federal funds rate is the central interest rate in the U.S.       
financial market. It influences other interest rates such as the prime
rate, which is the rate banks charge their customers with higher      
credit ratings. Additionally, the federal funds rate indirectly       
influences longer- term interest rates such as mortgages, loans, and  
savings, all of which are very important to consumer wealth and       
confidence.(2)

Yield to maturity on accrued principal.                               
Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities, or TIPS, are securities whose
principal is tied to the Consumer Price Index (CPI). The principal    
increases with inflation and decreases with deflation. When the       
security matures, the U.S. Treasury pays the original or adjusted     
principal, whichever is greater.

Notes
----------------------------------------------------------------------
This time series is an interpretation of Organisation of Economic     
Development (OECD) Composite Leading Indicators: Reference Turning    
Points and Component Series data, which can be found at               
http://www.oecd.org/std/leading-indicators/oecdcompositeleadingindicat
The OECD identifies months of turning points without designating a    
date within the month that turning points occurred. The dummy variable
adopts an arbitrary convention that the turning point occurred at a   
specific date within the month. The arbitrary convention does not     
reflect any judgment on this issue by the OECD. Our time series is    
composed of dummy variables that represent periods of expansion and   
recession. A value of 1 is a recessionary period, while a value of 0  
is an expansionary period. For this time series, the recession begins 
the first day of the period following a peak and ends on the last day 
of the period of the trough. For more options on recession shading,   
see the notes and links below.                                        
                                                                      
The recession shading data that we provide initially comes from the   
source as a list of dates that are either an economic peak or trough. 
We interpret dates into recession shading data using one of three     
arbitrary methods. All of our recession shading data is available     
using all three interpretations. The period between a peak and trough 
is always shaded as a recession. The peak and trough are collectively 
extrema. Depending on the application, the extrema, both individually 
and collectively, may be included in the recession period in whole or 
in part. In situations where a portion of a period is included in the 
recession, the whole period is deemed to be included in the recession 
period.                                                               
                                                                      
The first interpretation, known as the midpoint method, is to show a  
recession from the midpoint of the peak through the midpoint of the   
trough for monthly and quarterly data. For daily data, the recession  
begins on the 15th of the month of the peak and ends on the 15th of   
the month of the trough. Daily data is a disaggregation of monthly    
data. For monthly and quarterly data, the entire peak and trough      
periods are included in the recession shading. This method shows the  
maximum number of periods as a recession for monthly and quarterly    
data. The Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis uses this method in its   
own publications. A version of this time series represented using the 
midpoint method can be found at:

The second interpretation, known as the trough method, is to show a   
recession from the period following the peak through the trough (i.e. 
the peak is not included in the recession shading, but the trough is).
For daily data, the recession begins on the first day of the first    
month following the peak and ends on the last day of the month of the 
trough. Daily data is a disaggregation of monthly data. The trough    
method is used when displaying data on FRED graphs. The trough method 
is used for this series.                                              
                                                                      
The third interpretation, known as the peak method, is to show a      
recession from the period of the peak to the trough (i.e. the peak is 
included in the recession shading, but the trough is not). For daily  
data, the recession begins on the first day of the month of the peak  
and ends on the last day of the month preceding the trough. Daily data
is a disaggregation of monthly data. A version of this time series    
represented using the peak method can be found at:

The OECD CLI system is based on the "growth cycle" approach, where    
business cycles and turning points are measured and identified in the 
deviation-from-trend series. The main reference series used in the    
OECD CLI system for the majority of countries is industrial production
(IIP) covering all industry sectors excluding construction. This      
series is used because of its cyclical sensitivity and monthly        
availability, while the broad based Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is   
used to supplement the IIP series for identification of the final     
reference turning points in the growth cycle.                         
                                                                      
Zones aggregates of the CLIs and the reference series are calculated  
as weighted averages of the corresponding zone member series (i.e.    
CLIs and IIPs).                                                       
                                                                      
Up to December 2008 the turning points chronologies shown for         
regional/zone area aggregates or individual countries are determined  
by the rules established by the National Bureau of Economic Research  
(NBER) in the United States, which have been formalized and           
incorporated in a computer routine (Bry and Boschan) and included in  
the Phase-Average Trend (PAT) de-trending procedure. Starting from    
December 2008 the turning point detection algorithm is decoupled from 
the de-trending procedure, and is a simplified version of the original
Bry and Boschan routine. (The routine parses local minima and maxima  
in the cycle series and applies censor rules to guarantee alternating 
peaks and troughs, as well as phase and cycle length constraints.)    
                                                                      
The components of the CLI are time series which exhibit leading       
relationship with the reference series (IIP) at turning points.       
Country CLIs are compiled by combining de-trended smoothed and        
normalized components. The component series for each country are      
selected based on various criteria such as economic significance;     
cyclical behavior; data quality; timeliness and availability.         
                                                                      
The Euro area covers the Europe 16 area excluding Denmark, Sweden, and
United Kingdom.

implicit tax that reserve requirements used to impose on depository   
institutions.

Notes
----------------------------------------------------------------------
This time series is an interpretation of Organisation of Economic     
Development (OECD) Composite Leading Indicators: Reference Turning    
Points and Component Series data, which can be found at               
http://www.oecd.org/std/leading-indicators/oecdcompositeleadingindicat
The OECD identifies months of turning points without designating a    
date within the month that turning points occurred. The dummy variable
adopts an arbitrary convention that the turning point occurred at a   
specific date within the month. The arbitrary convention does not     
reflect any judgment on this issue by the OECD. Our time series is    
composed of dummy variables that represent periods of expansion and   
recession. A value of 1 is a recessionary period, while a value of 0  
is an expansionary period. For this time series, the recession begins 
the first day of the period of the peak and ends on the last day of   
the period before the trough. For more options on recession shading,  
see the notes and links below.                                        
                                                                      
The recession shading data that we provide initially comes from the   
source as a list of dates that are either an economic peak or trough. 
We interpret dates into recession shading data using one of three     
arbitrary methods. All of our recession shading data is available     
using all three interpretations. The period between a peak and trough 
is always shaded as a recession. The peak and trough are collectively 
extrema. Depending on the application, the extrema, both individually 
and collectively, may be included in the recession period in whole or 
in part. In situations where a portion of a period is included in the 
recession, the whole period is deemed to be included in the recession 
period.                                                               
                                                                      
The first interpretation, known as the midpoint method, is to show a  
recession from the midpoint of the peak through the midpoint of the   
trough for monthly and quarterly data. For daily data, the recession  
begins on the 15th of the month of the peak and ends on the 15th of   
the month of the trough. Daily data is a disaggregation of monthly    
data. For monthly and quarterly data, the entire peak and trough      
periods are included in the recession shading. This method shows the  
maximum number of periods as a recession for monthly and quarterly    
data. The Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis uses this method in its   
own publications. A version of this time series represented using the 
midpoint method can be found at:

The second interpretation, known as the trough method, is to show a   
recession from the period following the peak through the trough (i.e. 
the peak is not included in the recession shading, but the trough is).
For daily data, the recession begins on the first day of the first    
month following the peak and ends on the last day of the month of the 
trough. Daily data is a disaggregation of monthly data. The trough    
method is used when displaying data on FRED graphs. A version of this 
time series represented using the trough method can be found at:

The third interpretation, known as the peak method, is to show a      
recession from the period of the peak to the trough (i.e. the peak is 
included in the recession shading, but the trough is not). For daily  
data, the recession begins on the first day of the month of the peak  
and ends on the last day of the month preceding the trough. Daily data
is a disaggregation of monthly data. The peak method is used for this 
series.                                                               
                                                                      
The OECD CLI system is based on the "growth cycle" approach, where    
business cycles and turning points are measured and identified in the 
deviation-from-trend series. The main reference series used in the    
OECD CLI system for the majority of countries is industrial production
(IIP) covering all industry sectors excluding construction. This      
series is used because of its cyclical sensitivity and monthly        
availability, while the broad based Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is   
used to supplement the IIP series for identification of the final     
reference turning points in the growth cycle.                         
                                                                      
Zones aggregates of the CLIs and the reference series are calculated  
as weighted averages of the corresponding zone member series (i.e.    
CLIs and IIPs).                                                       
                                                                      
Up to December 2008 the turning points chronologies shown for         
regional/zone area aggregates or individual countries are determined  
by the rules established by the National Bureau of Economic Research  
(NBER) in the United States, which have been formalized and           
incorporated in a computer routine (Bry and Boschan) and included in  
the Phase-Average Trend (PAT) de-trending procedure. Starting from    
December 2008 the turning point detection algorithm is decoupled from 
the de-trending procedure, and is a simplified version of the original
Bry and Boschan routine. (The routine parses local minima and maxima  
in the cycle series and applies censor rules to guarantee alternating 
peaks and troughs, as well as phase and cycle length constraints.)    
                                                                      
The components of the CLI are time series which exhibit leading       
relationship with the reference series (IIP) at turning points.       
Country CLIs are compiled by combining de-trended smoothed and        
normalized components. The component series for each country are      
selected based on various criteria such as economic significance;     
cyclical behavior; data quality; timeliness and availability.

The overnight bank funding rate is calculated using federal funds     
transactions and certain Eurodollar transactions. The federal funds   
market consists of domestic unsecured borrowings in U.S. dollars by   
depository institutions from other depository institutions and certain
other entities, primarily government-sponsored enterprises, while the 
Eurodollar market consists of unsecured U.S. dollar deposits held at  
banks or bank branches outside of the United States. U.S.-based banks 
can also take Eurodollar deposits domestically through international  
banking facilities (IBFs). The overnight bank funding rate (OBFR) is  
calculated as a volume-weighted median of overnight federal funds     
transactions and Eurodollar transactions reported in the FR 2420      
Report of Selected Money Market Rates.                                
Volume-weighted median is the rate associated with transactions at the
50th percentile of transaction volume. Specifically, the              
volume-weighted median rate is calculated by ordering the transactions
from lowest to highest rate, taking the cumulative sum of volumes of  
these transactions, and identifying the rate associated with the      
trades at the 50th percentile of dollar volume. The published rates   
are the volume-weighted median transacted rate, rounded to the nearest
basis point.

day-to-day trading in the federal funds market.                       
                                                                      
A repurchase agreement (known as repo or RP) is a transaction in which
the New York Fed under the authorization and direction of the Federal 
Open Maker Committee buys a security from an eligible counterparty    
under an agreement to resell that security in the future. For these   
transactions, eligible securities are U.S. Treasury instruments,

Open Market Operations.                                               
                                                                      
Temporary open market operations involve short-term repurchase and    
reverse repurchase agreements that are designed to temporarily add or 
drain reserves available to the banking system and influence          
day-to-day trading in the federal funds market.                       
                                                                      
A reverse repurchase agreement (known as reverse repo or RRP) is a    
transaction in which the New York Fed under the authorization and     
direction of the Federal Open Market Committee sells a security to an 
eligible counterparty with an agreement to repurchase that same       
security at a specified price at a specific time in the future. For   
these transactions, eligible securities are U.S. Treasury instruments,
federal agency debt and the mortgage-backed securities issued or fully
guaranteed by federal agencies.

The observations for the S&P 500 represent the daily index value at   
market close.                                                         
                                                                      
The Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis and S&P Dow Jones Indices LLC   
have reached a new agreement on the use of Standard & Poors and Dow   
Jones Averages series in FRED. FRED and its associated services will  
include 10 years of daily history for Standard & Poors and Dow Jones  
Averages series.                                                      
                                                                      
The S&P 500 is regarded as a gauge of the large cap U.S. equities     
market. The index includes 500 leading companies in leading industries
of the U.S. economy, which are publicly held on either the NYSE or    
NASDAQ, and covers 75% of U.S. equities. Since this is a price index  
and not a total return index, the S&P 500 index here does not contain 
dividends.

The breakeven inflation rate represents a measure of expected         
inflation derived from 10-Year Treasury Constant Maturity Securities  
(BC_10YEAR) and 10-Year Treasury Inflation-Indexed Constant Maturity  
Securities (TC_10YEAR). The latest value implies what market          
participants expect inflation to be in the next 10 years, on average.

The breakeven inflation rate represents a measure of expected         
inflation derived from 5-Year Treasury Constant Maturity Securities   
(BC_5YEAR) and 5-Year Treasury Inflation-Indexed Constant Maturity    
Securities (TC_5YEAR). The latest value implies what market           
participants expect inflation to be in the next 5 years, on average.

This time series is an interpretation of Organisation of Economic     
Development (OECD) Composite Leading Indicators: Reference Turning    
Points and Component Series data, which can be found at               
http://www.oecd.org/std/leading-indicators/oecdcompositeleadingindicat
The OECD identifies months of turning points without designating a    
date within the month that turning points occurred. The dummy variable
adopts an arbitrary convention that the turning point occurred at a   
specific date within the month. The arbitrary convention does not     
reflect any judgment on this issue by the OECD. Our time series is    
composed of dummy variables that represent periods of expansion and   
recession. A value of 1 is a recessionary period, while a value of 0  
is an expansionary period. For this time series, the recession begins 
on the 15th day of the month of the peak and ends on the 15th day of  
the month of the trough. This time series is a disaggregation of the  
monthly series. For more options on recession shading, see the note   
and links below.                                                      
                                                                      
The recession shading data that we provide initially comes from the   
source as a list of dates that are either an economic peak or trough. 
We interpret dates into recession shading data using one of three     
arbitrary methods. All of our recession shading data is available     
using all three interpretations. The period between a peak and trough 
is always shaded as a recession. The peak and trough are collectively 
extrema. Depending on the application, the extrema, both individually 
and collectively, may be included in the recession period in whole or 
in part. In situations where a portion of a period is included in the 
recession, the whole period is deemed to be included in the recession 
period.                                                               
                                                                      
The first interpretation, known as the midpoint method, is to show a  
recession from the midpoint of the peak through the midpoint of the   
trough for monthly and quarterly data. For daily data, the recession  
begins on the 15th of the month of the peak and ends on the 15th of   
the month of the trough. Daily data is a disaggregation of monthly    
data. For monthly and quarterly data, the entire peak and trough      
periods are included in the recession shading. This method shows the  
maximum number of periods as a recession for monthly and quarterly    
data. The Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis uses this method in its   
own publications. The midpoint method is used for this series.        
                                                                      
The second interpretation, known as the trough method, is to show a   
recession from the period following the peak through the trough (i.e. 
the peak is not included in the recession shading, but the trough is).
For daily data, the recession begins on the first day of the first    
month following the peak and ends on the last day of the month of the 
trough. Daily data is a disaggregation of monthly data. The trough    
method is used when displaying data on FRED graphs. A version of this 
time series represented using the trough method can be found at:

The third interpretation, known as the peak method, is to show a      
recession from the period of the peak to the trough (i.e. the peak is 
included in the recession shading, but the trough is not). For daily  
data, the recession begins on the first day of the month of the peak  
and ends on the last day of the month preceding the trough. Daily data
is a disaggregation of monthly data. A version of this time series    
represented using the peak method can be found at:

The OECD CLI system is based on the "growth cycle" approach, where    
business cycles and turning points are measured and identified in the 
deviation-from-trend series. The main reference series used in the    
OECD CLI system for the majority of countries is industrial production
(IIP) covering all industry sectors excluding construction. This      
series is used because of its cyclical sensitivity and monthly        
availability, while the broad based Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is   
used to supplement the IIP series for identification of the final     
reference turning points in the growth cycle.                         
                                                                      
Zones aggregates of the CLIs and the reference series are calculated  
as weighted averages of the corresponding zone member series (i.e.    
CLIs and IIPs).                                                       
                                                                      
Up to December 2008 the turning points chronologies shown for         
regional/zone area aggregates or individual countries are determined  
by the rules established by the National Bureau of Economic Research  
(NBER) in the United States, which have been formalized and           
incorporated in a computer routine (Bry and Boschan) and included in  
the Phase-Average Trend (PAT) de-trending procedure. Starting from    
December 2008 the turning point detection algorithm is decoupled from 
the de-trending procedure, and is a simplified version of the original
Bry and Boschan routine. (The routine parses local minima and maxima  
in the cycle series and applies censor rules to guarantee alternating 
peaks and troughs, as well as phase and cycle length constraints.)    
                                                                      
The components of the CLI are time series which exhibit leading       
relationship with the reference series (IIP) at turning points.       
Country CLIs are compiled by combining de-trended smoothed and        
normalized components. The component series for each country are      
selected based on various criteria such as economic significance;     
cyclical behavior; data quality; timeliness and availability.

This time series is an interpretation of US Business Cycle Expansions 
and Contractions data provided by The National Bureau of Economic     
Research (NBER) at http://www.nber.org/cycles/cyclesmain.html. The    
NBER identifies months and quarters of turning points without         
designating a date within the period that turning points occurred. The
dummy variable adopts an arbitrary convention that the turning point  
occurred at a specific date within the period. The arbitrary          
convention does not reflect any judgment on this issue by the NBER's  
Business Cycle Dating Committee. Our time series is composed of dummy 
variables that represent periods of expansion and recession. A value  
of 1 is a recessionary period, while a value of 0 is an expansionary  
period. For this time series, the recession begins on the 15th day of 
the month of the peak and ends on the 15th day of the month of the    
trough. This time series is a disaggregation of the monthly series.   
For more options on recession shading, see the note and links below.  
                                                                      
The recession shading data that we provide initially comes from the   
source as a list of dates that are either an economic peak or trough. 
We interpret dates into recession shading data using one of three     
arbitrary methods. All of our recession shading data is available     
using all three interpretations. The period between a peak and trough 
is always shaded as a recession. The peak and trough are collectively 
extrema. Depending on the application, the extrema, both individually 
and collectively, may be included in the recession period in whole or 
in part. In situations where a portion of a period is included in the 
recession, the whole period is deemed to be included in the recession 
period.                                                               
                                                                      
The first interpretation, known as the midpoint method, is to show a  
recession from the midpoint of the peak through the midpoint of the   
trough for monthly and quarterly data. For daily data, the recession  
begins on the 15th of the month of the peak and ends on the 15th of   
the month of the trough. Daily data is a disaggregation of monthly    
data. For monthly and quarterly data, the entire peak and trough      
periods are included in the recession shading. This method shows the  
maximum number of periods as a recession for monthly and quarterly    
data. The Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis uses this method in its   
own publications. A version of this time series represented using the 
midpoint method can be found at:

The second interpretation, known as the trough method, is to show a   
recession from the period following the peak through the trough (i.e. 
the peak is not included in the recession shading, but the trough is).
For daily data, the recession begins on the first day of the first    
month following the peak and ends on the last day of the month of the 
trough. Daily data is a disaggregation of monthly data. The trough    
method is used when displaying data on FRED graphs. The midpoint      
method is used for this series.                                       
                                                                      
The third interpretation, known as the peak method, is to show a      
recession from the period of the peak to the trough (i.e. the peak is 
included in the recession shading, but the trough is not). For daily  
data, the recession begins on the first day of the month of the peak  
and ends on the last day of the month preceding the trough. Daily data
is a disaggregation of monthly data. A version of this time series    
represented using the peak method can be found at:

period.                                                               
                                                                      
The first interpretation, known as the midpoint method, is to show a  
recession from the midpoint of the peak through the midpoint of the   
trough for monthly and quarterly data. For daily data, the recession  
begins on the 15th of the month of the peak and ends on the 15th of   
the month of the trough. Daily data is a disaggregation of monthly    
data. For monthly and quarterly data, the entire peak and trough      
periods are included in the recession shading. This method shows the  
maximum number of periods as a recession for monthly and quarterly    
data. The Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis uses this method in its   
own publications. A version of this time series represented using the 
midpoint method can be found at:

The second interpretation, known as the trough method, is to show a   
recession from the period following the peak through the trough (i.e. 
the peak is not included in the recession shading, but the trough is).
For daily data, the recession begins on the first day of the first    
month following the peak and ends on the last day of the month of the 
trough. Daily data is a disaggregation of monthly data. The trough    
method is used when displaying data on FRED graphs. A version of this 
time series represented using the trough method can be found at:

The third interpretation, known as the peak method, is to show a      
recession from the period of the peak to the trough (i.e. the peak is 
included in the recession shading, but the trough is not). For daily  
data, the recession begins on the first day of the month of the peak  
and ends on the last day of the month preceding the trough. Daily data
is a disaggregation of monthly data. The peak method is used for this 
series.
